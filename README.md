# NameMC Scrape Tool

This is a tool to scrape NameMC using message previews generated by discord.

To set up:
1. Create a chats.json file, and use the format "[chat1_id,chat2_id,chat3_id]", putting in chats which the discord bot has access to.
1. Create a config.json file, and use the format "{"token":"botToken"}", inputting the token of a discord bot that you wish to use, which has access to the chats in chats.json
1. Run main.py.
